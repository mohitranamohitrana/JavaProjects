PROJ 3 Pseudo

Quadrant 1

Create character array “ip“ and input the ip address
Create character array “message” containing “Please”
Create character array “password”

Connect to server with using ip and port 1024
If connected print “Connected”
If not connected print “Connection failed”
Send “message” array to server
Receive the password from the server into “password” array
Send “password” array to the server to open the gate.

Wait for 1 second
Set motors to move forwards

Quadrant 2 

Create a list
For each pixel across picture
	Get intensity of pixel from middle row
	If the intensity is lower than the black threshold
		Add 1 to the list
	Otherwise add 0 to the list
Create variable total and make it 0
For the size of the list
To the total, add each list item multiplied by (the index of the item minus half the list size)
If the value is higher than the total threshold
	Turn left
If the value is lower than the negative of the total threshold
	Turn right
Otherwise
Move forwards

Scan the rows of pixels along the horizontal
Make a vector 
Push back the row number minus the total rows divided by 2 to get the centre as 0 
Scan the column until end of column 
Find the black threshold 
Make another vector to count the black pixels as 1 
Get blackpixel at  each row and column 
If the blackpixel found is lesser than or equal to black threshold 
Push back 1 into the vector 
If it is not then push back 0
Get the scalar multiple of both vector 
If it is a negative number then turn right
If it is a positive number then turn left
