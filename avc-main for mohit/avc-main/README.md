# ENGR 101 Project 3

## Autonomous Vehicle Challenge

### Roles:
- Hardware : working on the physical design of the robot/vehicle and building. 
- Software Architect : writing up the psuedo-code.
- Coder : writing up the actual code.
- Tester : testing the robot/vehicle once the code has been finished & giving feedback to the group.

### General Software Design
The code is divided by quadrant. Each quadrant has a specific function or set of functions for the course that the bot takes:
- Quadrant 1: Connects to the WiFi using E101 library functions and opens gate/follows line.
- Quadrant 2: Uses pixel sampling to detect a black line and applies PID control for steering.
- Quadrant 3: Detects intersections using line breaks and selects a turn strategy.
- Quadrant 4: Uses pixel color detection (red) to navigate towards the red cylinder.

Main loop will check for which quadrant the robot is in and call the appropriate logic function.

| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |------|------|
|6/05/25|Prototype Design|All|8/05/25|Create the first prototype bot, produce plan and improvements to be made as bot progresses.|Weight distribution tested and base prototype made. Blender used to create weight object for balancing model. Improvements to bot design suggested and uploaded to Doc.|
|12/05/25|Prototype Test|All|15/05/25|Test movement of bot prototype. Record the results and any issues. Make adjustments and modifications to design while testing.|13/05 - Tested the prototype robot. When testing the movement, we discovered one of the motors for the wheels had a faulty connector and would not work, so it was replaced with a functioning motor. The prototype also had trouble staying balanced due to the wheels not having anything to balance with. The prototype base was also too small for the battery to fit into.|
|12/05/25|3D Print: Weight Distributor|Mohit|12/05/25|Print out 3D Model made on 8/05 for addition to bot prototype.|13/05 - Successfully printed and installed the marble caster weight distributor to the robot, allowing it to stay balanced.|
|13/05/25|v2 Design|All|15/05/25|Design and create second version of bot using the results from the prototype.|15/05 - Built a second version of the robot based on results from the Prototype test. Used better quality materials for the base of the robot and modified the size to accomodate both the raspberry pi and battery. Also installed the camera which is connected to a motor at the front of the robot. Will test the movement of both the robot and camera next lab session.|
